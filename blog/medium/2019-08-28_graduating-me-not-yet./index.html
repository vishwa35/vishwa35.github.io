    <h4 id="last-august-i-realized-i-would-graduate-in-mayearlier-than-expected-i-wasnt-mentally-prepared-i-didnt-know-what-i-wanted-to-pursue-career-wise-so-i-figured-another-internship">Last August I realized I would graduate in May — earlier than expected. I wasn’t mentally prepared; I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue career-wise. So I figured, another internship?</h4>
<p><img src="images/1.jpeg" alt="image"></p>
<p>I learned a ton this winter while at Lyft. My work was primarily related to data pipelines, and with the mentorship from Dan Fan and Ikramul Haq (and great feedback culture!) I strengthened my ability to evaluate technical design decisions, communicate across teams, and build solid services.</p>
<p>More broadly, I talked to several people about their career trajectories, which ranged from “I started coding at 14” to “I took a 2 year break after a few years in X and then got into tech.”</p>
<p>I came to terms with the idea that I’m probably never going to know if I want to do something for the rest of my life, at least starting out. I aspire to be impactful in the environment I’m in, and as my experiences continue to inform my decisions moving forward, I imagine that environment might evolve to something else. (or not?)</p>
<p>While I may only have slightly more clarity than I did in August, I’m now excited to graduate, and for the self and global discovery to continue.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dan and Courtney for encouraging me to reach out to people, and to those who shared their stories — this winter or before.</p>
