<p>Both a work of art I created in Printmaking class as well as a commentary on my motto for life.</p>
<p>I’m writing this 3 weeks after the end of the program, because I’ve been extremely busy since it ended. And I need to write this for my CAS reflection anyway.</p>
<p>Taking art and design classes was a relatively new experience; I didn’t have this kind of opportunity before, and I never really considered it a priority. I only recently became interested in design, as I discovered it through journalism and making club t-shirts. This program was actually my second choice after SAMS (the math and science program), but if I had to choose now, I would pick Art and Design over SAMS any day. This is not because I prefer art/design over math/science. In fact, I don’t. I still intend to pursue a STEM oriented career, though now I want to infuse it with elements of design. Rather, the art and design program provided me with a unique experience — I got to interact with people who look at the world in a totally different perspective. To them, the computer science kids were the weird ones. My peers and instructors all contributed to my realization that I could actually make art. My lack of experience, prior instruction, and art history background was not as big of an obstacle as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>When I applied to the program and looked at the classes, I thought drawing, painting, and sculpture would be pretty bland. Animation, Photography, and the design classes would be interesting. And printmaking? Well, I didn’t even know what that meant.</p>
<p>I came to Carnegie Mellon and took all 6 classes. Now, I can easily say that aside from the design classes, my favorite were sculpture and printmaking. While I’ve always loved creating, I didn’t realize that translated to art as well. Traditionally, I’ve focused on functional objects. My abilities are far-reaching, and my potential is waiting to be reached.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest lesson learned from this program is that I can do anything if I put my mind to it. While I had known that in theory, I had never really felt it from the inside. I worked hard during open studio hours to produce work I was proud of. I think my initial fear of the unknown seriously helped me work hard, and that is the best thing to happen to me to date.</p>
<p>The college experience was great, and it has motivated me to work as hard on my applications as possible; I want to go somewhere that can give me the same kind of motivation to work hard, and an environment that fosters students like those. Friendly instructors, hardworking students, and a resourceful campus combined to form a life-changing experience.</p>
