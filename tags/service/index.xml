      <description>DominiCANT Believe It’s Over *The title of this should&#39;ve been a &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Nhu&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Worldview, because of the puns made on this trip, but for it to make sense to others, I opted to keep it like it is.
I just returned from a trip to the Dominican Republic. I&#39;ve changed as a person through the experience, gaining a new perspective on the world and its people. I went with the Ryan Nece Foundation (@powerofgiving ) as a part of the Student Service Program, and I am so thankful that I got this opportunity.</description>
